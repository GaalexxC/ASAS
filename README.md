A bash script that automates Nginx, PHP, MySQL, Bind9 DNS, vsFTPd, PHP-FPM Setup and User/Domain setup in a couple minutes. For new/fresh servers, existing servers, and local servers (development). Can be used to add new users / domains and home / application directory structures anytime.

Uses a standard default $HOME/$USER/public_html directory structure but can be edited for any type directory structure of choice

### New Major Version v2.10

#### New Menu Options

ASAS requires several small applications to function properly such as whiptail, Python Software Properties and software-properties-common.
If applicable, dependencies will be installed by script automagically.

  1. Nginx Installer (Stable/Mainline/Compiled)
  2. PHP Installer (5.6 - 7.0 - 7.1)
  3. MySQL Installer (Percona-MariaDB-Oracle)
  4. Bind9 DNS Installer (Configure-Secure)
  5. vsFTPd Installer (Configure-Secure)
  6. Mail Server Installer (Postfix-Dovecot)
  7. Quick Web User & Domain Setup
  8. Security Tools
  9. System Tools
  10. Exit
 
#### OS Compatibility
- Ubuntu Server 14.04 / 16.04 / 16.10 / 17.04 / 17.10
- Debian 8, 9

####Removed due to end of Life
- Removed Ubuntu Server 12.04 future support
- Removed PHP 5.4 and 5.5 support end of life security updates
 
#### Added Custom Compile Nginx
- Custom compile latest Nginx mainline with latest OpenSSL. Get the latest security enhancements and features as well as add your own custom modules when building Nginx.
Install will create all necessary directories, service scripts, and update all configuration files.
NOTE: Best when installed on a new system, do not install with nginx installed via apt.
Also when using this method you must run the compiler option (2) each time you update your Nginx version.

#### Added Local Server support
- Changed the way port and server is added to the nginx vhost file. 
  * Added a port specification configuration for the vhost so you can choose something like 8080 /8081 for a local server or use the standard port 80 for remote server in order to access via web.
  * Added server hostname configuration to the vhost so you can choose something like devserver or appserver for a local development server [(IE Hyper-V-Win 10-Ubuntu devServer)](https://github.com/GaryCornell/Win-10-Hyper-V-Ubuntu-16.x-Perfect-Dev-Server) or use the standard domain.com for remote server.

#### New directory setup
You can now use any type of home directory and DocumentRoot setup imaginable with no editing of variables.
IE /home /home2 /var /usr/local | public_html, www, htdocs, sites, wwwroot, httpdocs ...etc
  
#### Added Quick System Cleanup
Cleans up the repo sources, temp files, old logs and safely remove older kernels not in use to free up critical space on your box.  

#### Added Logging
Debug, Error, Info logging

#### Added Backup functions
Database, Home DIR, Custom files and directories

#### New Software Install Options

- Added vsFTPd install and configure
- Added Oracle MySQL Server install and configure
- Added MariaDB Server install and configure
- Added Bind9 DNS Server install and configure
- Added Nginx Stable Web Server install and configure
- Added PHP 5.6 and PHP 7.1 installers. 

## Functions

- Setup/Create Nginx directory structure, sites_available / sites_enabled / domain.vhost conf / conf.d (if doesnt exist)

- Updates cgi.fix_pathinfo=0 in fpm and cli php.ini and disables dangerous PHP functions (if doesnt exist)

- Optional my.cnf optimization for MySQL Server

- Setup/Create php-fpm directory structure, domain.conf

- Setup/Create user/pass with domain/IP or hostname/port for local server with public/web directory structure

- Setup/Create Nginx gzip mime types and relevant cache directories (editable in nginx.conf)

- Sets all proper permissions on relevant directories.

- Restarts services

- Adds index.php skel to public directory


### Creates the following $HOME directory structure

The script by default uses the following structure but can be edited to accomadate any type setup IE /var/www , /var/htdocs, etc.

* $HOME
    * $USER
        * _sessions
        * backups
        * logs
        * public_html
             * index.php
        * ssl
        
        
## Editable

See [/src/variables.conf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GaryCornell/ASAS/master/src/variables.conf) for editable fields

## Simple Usage as root

1. cd /opt  (Any directory you choose is fine)

2. wget # (Early BETA - Not available yet)

3. tar xvpfz 

4. cd 

5. chmod u+x 

6. ./

7. Just follow the prompts

8. The Nginx vhost file is updated with the latest security features for SSL if using a cert you must uncomment and make sure paths are correct. The script sets up the standard path $HOME/$USER/ssl to .crt/.key/trusted_chain.pem but of course you must supply the files. Root path/logs path/php-fpm unix socket and sessions paths are setup and work out of the box for you but can be edited for custom paths.

9. Once completed:
Local Server: Go to your sites web address (EX: http://loacalhost:8080 ) and start building immediately!
Remote Server: if your DNS is setup then you can access your site immediately (EX: http://www.domain.com )
